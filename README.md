# C_Primer_Plus_Assignments
This repository includes weekly assignments from the book 'C Primer Plus'

The book 'C Primer Plus' is a highly recommended text book in the read list of my first year C programming module, and all the documents in this repository are exercises on this book implemented and practiced by myself. 

By inplmenting these exercises, from fundamental knowledge such as for loop and while loop to more complicated concepts such as linked structure and binary search tree,
it provides me solid and robust on hand experience and practical skills on C programming.
